### where LAT_N is the northern latitude and LONG_W is the western longitude.

Q7. Query a list of CITY and STATE from the STATION table.
Solution:
```sql
SELECT CITY, STATE FROM STATION;
```

Q8. Query a list of CITY names from STATION for cities that have an even ID number. Print the results in any order, but exclude duplicates from the answer.

Solution:
```sql
SELECT DISTINCT CITY FROM STATION WHERE MOD (ID,2) = 0 ORDER BY CITY;
```

Q9. Query the two cities in STATION with the shortest and longest CITY names, as well as their respective lengths (i.e.: number of characters in the name). If there is more than one smallest or largest city, choose the one that comes first when ordered alphabetically.

Solution:
```sql
SELECT CITY, LENGTH(CITY) FROM STATION ORDER BY LENGTH(CITY) ASC, CITY LIMIT 1;
SELECT CITY, LENGTH(CITY) FROM STATION ORDER BY LENGTH(CITY) DESC, CITY LIMIT 1;
```

Q10. Find the difference between the total number of CITY entries in the table and the number of distinct CITY entries in the table.

Solution:
```sql
SELECT COUNT(CITY) â€“ COUNT (DISTINCT CITY) FROM STATION;
```

Q11. Query the list of CITY names starting with vowels (i.e., a, e, i, o, or u) from STATION. Your result cannot contain duplicates.

Solution:
```sql
SELECT DISTINCT CITY FROM STATION WHERE LEFT(CITY,1) IN ('A','E','I','O','U');
```

Q12. Query the list of CITY names ending with vowels (a, e, i, o, u) from STATION. Your result cannot contain duplicates.

Solution:
```sql
SELECT DISTINCT CITY FROM STATION WHERE RIGHT(CITY,1) IN ('A','E','I','O','U');
```

Q13. Query the list of CITY names from STATION which have vowels (i.e., a, e, i, o, and u) as both their first and last characters. Your result cannot contain duplicates.

Solution:
```sql

```

Q16. Query the list of CITY names from STATION that either do not start with vowels or do not end with vowels. Your result cannot contain duplicates.

Solution:
```sql
SELECT DISTINCT CITY FROM STATION WHERE LEFT(CITY,1) NOT IN ('A','E','I','O','U') OR 
RIGHT(CITY,1) NOT IN ('A','E','I','O','U');
```

Q17. Query the list of CITY names from STATION that do not start with vowels and do not end with vowels. Your result cannot contain duplicates.
Solution:
```sql
SELECT DISTINCT CITY FROM STATION WHERE LEFT(CITY,1) NOT IN ('A','E','I','O','U') AND
RIGHT(CITY,1) NOT IN ('A','E','I','O','U');
```

### The Name column only contains uppercase (A-Z) and lowercase (a-z) letters.

Q 18. Query the Name of any student in STUDENTS who scored higher than  Marks. Order your output by the last three characters of each name. If two or more students both have names ending in the same last three characters (i.e.: Bobby, Robby, etc.), secondary sort them by ascending ID.

Solution:
```sql
SELECT NAME FROM STUDENTS WHERE MARKS > 75 ORDER BY RIGHT(NAME,3), ID ASC;
```

### where employee_id is an employee's ID number, name is their name, months is the total number of months they've been working for the company, and salary is their monthly salary.

Q 19. Write a query that prints a list of employee names (i.e.: the name attribute) from the Employee table in alphabetical order.
Solution:

```sql
SELECT NAME FROM EMPLOYEE ORDER BY NAME;
```
